# Project Stage One

## Pick a Punk

We're going to use the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) to create a web app that lets you browse Brewdog's back catalogue of beer. You'll be able to shortlist your favourites and run search/filters on the whole collection.

The web app will be written in Vue.js. In time it may become a PWA but we won't consider that till later.

## Today

The plan for this session is to get the following set up:

- **Vue** via the new CLI
- **Git** repo
- **Routes** - we'll map out all the routes required using Vue Router
- **Hosting** on Netlify
- **Design** - we'll break down the design and start thinking about components
